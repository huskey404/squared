    <h1>To check if this works, click the ðŸ§© icon in the top right (extensions)</h1>
    <h2>If your school tracker extension says "No Access" or "Access Requested", then your school cannot see disguised tabs!</h2>

    <h2>If it says full access, close this tab immediately.</h2>
    Do not open the main website, as this will cause your school to block the main website source code. 
    Also, do not open the github repo on your school account as well, because that links back to the main website.
